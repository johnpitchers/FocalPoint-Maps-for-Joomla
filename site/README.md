Build 1.2.1

Minor fix to default map template 


Build: 1.2

Started as a bug fix release but grew to include new features.
Added the option to display the map or list view in the first tab. It's in the global configuration and can be overridden in the map settings.
Fix language issues. All english text hard coded in the template files has been replaced with language declarations and can be overridden with language files in the normal way.
Custom field options now include Select Boxes and Multi Select Boxes.
Better, more refined icon pins and cluster icons.
The infobox "Find out more" link can now link to a menu item.
Removed the ability to change the name of a custom field once it has been saved. This was causing issues with data being lost when the custom field name was altered.
Fixed missing div in sidebar sub-template.
Custom fields are now accessible in the map view. Previously they were only available in the locations view. A note has been added to the default template files.
Custom field values can now be displayed in location descriptions and infoboxes by wrapping the custom field name in curly brakets. ie {your-custom-field}. This will be extended in 1.3 with the ability to define an infobox template.
